What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	the file is connected to GIT. by initializing it, the file is
	tucked away in Git (not in visible part of the Windows Explorer)
	now we can deal with it in  Git.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	It is connecting both sides by offering an intermediate saving space.
	it bundles commits and therefore is a prestep before becoming a part
	of the reposity
