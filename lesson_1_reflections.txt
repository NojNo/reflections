How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   it was faster

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    im more flexible and saves time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You do not have too many versions on the one hand or too big steps in between 2 versions on the other. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it depends on the files you are working on. if they are interrelated you need the saving method of git, which saves the updates simultaneously at once
	if you are using independent files, you can also use a saving รก la Google

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    by using first log you can see all the recent commits and its IDs. By using diff oldID newID you can check which changes have been done. + and - 
	are proportional to the amount of changes. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Every step I take is restorable. so a created bug can be corrected later.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to use Git as a Do or Undo button for my programs
