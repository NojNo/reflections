When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
it´s great to use the remote repository in order to be independent from the location. e.g. working at different computers or many people working/ 
checking through a file. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It might be that I am not completely finish with the branch so that an unfished part could be pushed or pulled.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks rep. coying on GitHub level
clones rep download or copying from one local PC to another
branch are creating in one rep.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It´s biggest advantage is, that you can work offline in one rep on different branches,
without having to merge the commits immediately.
